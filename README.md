Autofiling-Email-Attachments for Outlook - Deprecated
=====================================================

I am no longer using this script. Please test thoroughly and update as needed if you choose to use this.

An applescript that saves an attachment to a nested folder structure based on the email senders name. To be used in conjunction with Hazel to tag files.

Updated to fix issue that selecting single message crashed.
